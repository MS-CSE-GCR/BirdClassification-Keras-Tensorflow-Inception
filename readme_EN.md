## Bird classification

### Background
This experiment is based on bird images dataset of Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 (CUB-200-2011). We use Transfer Learning and InceptionV3 network, with Azure Data Science Virtual Machine and its pre-installed Keras and Tensorflow framework to implement bird classification.

### Experiment Environment

- Azure Data Science Virtual Machine: NC6 size, Ubuntu
- Keras 2.0.9
- Tensorflow 1.4.0
- Anaconda Python 3.5.2 with CUDA 8.0

#### 1. Create Azure DSVM

Search Azure Data Science Virtual Machine on global Azure portal and start creating. Notice to choose Ubuntu system, HDD type and NC6 size. After created, connet to the VM by Putty.

#### 2. Training environment configuration

Config Keras's backend as Tensorflow. Find keras.json json in "/home/<username>/.keras".
If you want to use Python environment, run "source activate py35" to start the virtual environment.
